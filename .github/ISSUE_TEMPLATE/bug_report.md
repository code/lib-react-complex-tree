<!--
Since react-complex-tree has matured a lot since I've started working on it, I have started a successor library
that is available here: https://headless-tree.lukasbach.com

You might find that the issue you have is already fixed or working in Headless Tree, and I suggest you try
to see if that library fulfills your needs. Nevertheless, I still continue to maintain react-complex-tree,
so feel free to post issues or PRs here.
